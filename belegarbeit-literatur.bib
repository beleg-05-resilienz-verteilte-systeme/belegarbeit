    abstract = {We review some of the most widely used patterns for the programming of microservices: circuit breaker, service discovery, and API gateway. By systematically analysing different deployment strategies for these patterns, we reach new insight especially for the application of circuit breakers. We also evaluate the applicability of Jolie, a language for the programming of microservices, for these patterns and report on other standard frameworks offering similar solutions. Finally, considerations for future developments are presented.},

    ABSTRACT = {Cloud computing has emerged as the primary choice for developers in developing applications that require high-performance computing. Virtualization technology has helped in the distribution of resources to multiple users. Increased use of cloud infrastructure has led to the challenge of developing a load balancing mechanism to provide optimized use of resources and better performance. Round robin and least connections load balancing algorithms have been developed to allocate user requests across a cluster of servers in the cloud in a time-bound manner. In this paper, we have applied the round robin and least connections approach of load balancing to HAProxy, virtual machine clusters and web servers. The experimental results are visualized and summarized using Apache Jmeter and a further comparative study of round robin and least connections is also depicted. Experimental setup and results show that the round robin algorithm performs better as compared to the least connections algorithm in all measuring parameters of load balancer in this paper.},
